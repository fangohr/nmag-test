To use the test suite you'll need first to configure it.
Either enter the config directory and type

  bash find_nsim.bash

Or explicitly select which version of nsim to test by doing:

  /path/to/nsim/exec/to/test/nsim setup.py

After doing that the test suite will be configured and all the examples
contained in it should work using the found/selected nsim executable.
