This testing directory is built as follows:

There is a global makefile in this directory, which calls all simulations in subdirectories.

Each simulation produced a file with 4 columns, containing time, Mx,
My, Mz in SI units and stores this in results/X where X is an
indicative name (such as 'nmag3'.

The global makefile provides a target 'plots' which will plot all data
in the results directory togother.

For the OOMMF and Magpar runs, I suggest to add their data in
results/X to the svn repository so that these don't need to be
computed again.

The makefile target 'plot' will update files 'results.eps' and
'results.png' which show reference data from oommf, magpar,
nmag4_rXXXX, and any new data that has been copied into that
directory.
