Nmeshmirror
===========

Nmeshmirror is a script which allows to create a periodic mesh
out of a regular periodic-free mesh. The given mesh must be a
segment in 1D, a rectangle in 2D or a prism in 3D, and the 
periodicity can be defined along any of the main axes of the mesh.
Given a mesh, the script searches for the minimum and maximum
values of the points coordinates along the main axes. These
values are used to define planes, which are then used to
mirror the mesh according to the parameter defining the 
mirroring directions. When the value for a given axis is 1, 
the mesh is mirrored along the positive direction of that axis,
while it is mirrored along the negative direction if the value is -1. 
When the value is 0, the mesh is not mirrored along the given axis.
To recognize which points on the mirroring plane should be considered
coincident we use the parameter ``error1``: a mirrored point which is 
within an error1 distance from its parent point is considered
coincident with the parent point. A further parameter
is the ``error2``. Taking the plane of the points which will become
periodic under the mirroring operation, a point is assumed to lie on
the plane only if the distance plane-point is smaller than error2.
To make this definitions clearer, we use the mesh defined in
`org.nmesh <org.nmesh>`__  as the initial mesh: 

  .. include:: org.nmesh
    :literal:

Such mesh has the following structure:

.. image:: orig-mesh.png
   :width: 7.0cm
   :align: center

If now we mirror this mesh along the positive x-axis (that is along the
plane defined by x=1), the result is the following:

.. image:: mirror1.png
   :width: 12.0cm
   :align: center

The command used to generate such mesh is the following::

   $ nmeshmirror org.nmesh 1e-6 1e-6 1,0 mirror1.nmesh

which corresponds to the following parameters::

   $ nmeshmirror initial_mesh error1 error2 axes final_mesh

and the errors previously defined are graphically shown in the following image:   

.. image:: errors.png
   :width: 12.0cm
   :align: center

If we want to mirror `org.nmesh <org.nmesh>`__  along the negative x-axis (that is along the
plane defined by x=0), on the command line we run the command::

   $ nmeshmirror org.nmesh 1e-6 1e-6 -1,0 mirror2.nmesh

and the result is the following:

.. image:: mirror2.png
   :width: 12.0cm
   :align: center

In analogy to the previous commands, to mirror `org.nmesh
<org.nmesh>`__  along the positive y-axis 
(that is along the plane defined by y=1), on the command line we run the command::

   $ nmeshmirror org.nmesh 1e-6 1e-6 0,1 mirror3.nmesh

and obtain the following result:

.. image:: mirror3.png
   :width: 6.0cm
   :align: center

If we want to have a periodic mesh along both the x and y axes
(for instance along the positive directions), it is sufficient 
to set to 1 all the axis affected by this mirroring operation.
On the command line we then run the command::

   $ nmeshmirror org.nmesh 1e-6 1e-6 1,1 mirror4.nmesh

which gives the following mesh:

.. image:: mirror4.png
   :width: 12.0cm
   :align: center

where the periodic points are 3, that is the four external corners
(which account for just one point because they are periodically
coincident), the central point on the left and right external boundaries,
and the central point on the top and bottom external boundaries.
